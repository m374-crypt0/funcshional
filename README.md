# funcshional

A bash library that empowers `bash` with functional programming constructs.

## getting started

- best way to use is to integrate this library as a git submodule to your bash
  project:
  - `git submodule add https://github.com/MetaBarj0/funcshional.git [dir]/funcshional`
    where \[dir] is a directory within your repository
- include the library in the bash script of your choice using:
  - `. "[dir]/funcshional/src/funcshional.sh`
    where \[dir] is a directory within your repository where you added the
    `funcshional` repository
- pipe everything you need to get clear and elegant FP construct within your
  fancy bash project
